# IoW-PIDsvc

This is a suite of tools to manage persistent identifiers and redirects based on the PIDsvc developed by CSIRO. https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/Siss/PIDService#Prerequisites. Modifications to the CSIRO PIDsvc, the [dockerization done by @OzNome](https://github.com/oznome/pidsvc-docker), and new automation tools are managed in this repository, largely in service of the [geoconnex.us](https://github.com/internetofwater/geoconnex.us) project implementing [SELFIE](https://github.com/opengeospatial/SELFIE) practices in the United States
